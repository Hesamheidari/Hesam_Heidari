## What happened when I chose computer engineering? 
<p> 
Actualy, i was very confused about what field to pursue at university. but i was interseted in programming beacause in my secendary school a programming class was held. my teacher adviced to learining java script and 1 year later we learned androind programming in android studio.
When i went to university I thought that learning programming in Ordinary classes in institues are no different from universities. but actualy, learning this in universities are so better than ordinary classes.

## Are you <strong><em>really satisfied</em> with studying in this field? 
<p> 
Yes, a lot. The present age is the age of technology and computer engineering is the main field in the field of **new technology**. 
I think that about 200 years ago The Industrial Revolution took place and in these years Computer, Internet and technical revolution is happening. 
 

## What are your future plans for learning programming?

 My priority for learning programming languages is as follows: 
 
 <ol>
<li>C++ language</li>
<li>Java script</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>PHP</li>
 <li>JQuery</li>
